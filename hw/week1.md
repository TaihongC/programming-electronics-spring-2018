### Homework 1 (first part due Monday, January 22. 2018)

This homework has two parts; first, complete the exercises we began in class today. Second, share your solutions with someone else from class and ask them to "sign off" that your programs solve the puzzles!

#### Red Dot Puzzles (due Monday)

- First, [**read through the building blocks we covered**](../building-blocks-programs.md) and make sure it all makes sense. If you have any questions about anything, email [Chris](mailto:cantor@cca.edu) or [Yisel](mailto:yrosariochang@cca.edu)!

- Finish solving the [puzzles](../puzzle-sheets.pdf) we started in class. Remember, your goal is to give instructions to Rudy, the red dot, so that it passes over (collects) all the green dots.

- Each page in that PDF contains one or more puzzles that should be solved by the same program; make sure each program solves all the puzzles on its page.

- Publish your programs on the web, and [send me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) a link. For this class, use GitHub to publish your work by [following this tutorial](http://github.com/zamfi/github-guide); make a new repository for each week's homework, and call this first one `hw1`. Then add or upload your solution to *each puzzle in its own file*, named `puzzle-1.program`, `puzzle-2.program`, *etc.*

#### Sharing & Caring (due Tuesday)

You'll receive a link from me for someone else's homework.

- When you receive a link to evaluate, look at each program and run through it to make sure that it solves the corresponding puzzle.

- If it doesn't, file a "bug report"!

  - Click the "Issues" tab at the top of the github page, and create a new issue with the bug you found. Make sure to include the puzzle number and what you think is going on, so the author can fix their code.
